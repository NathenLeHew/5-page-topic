The Survival Game I recomend is green hell. It is based of something similar to the
amazon rain forest you get lost on an island and you explore with nothing but a
walkie talkie and a backpack you have to learn how to survival you have to gather
stone from rocks break trees and find a clean water source what makes this game
so hard is that theres many difficulties you have to find water which is hard to find
walking through the bushes and water can cause you to aquire leeches that you have to
remove you have a health, hunger, sanity, and a nutrientions bar to beware of.
any small cuts can cause infection and require maggots to eat the infection.
theres also tribesman to beware of who are very violent.
