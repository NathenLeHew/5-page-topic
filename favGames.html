        <h3>My Top Three Favorite Games</h3>
        <ul class="listNone">
          <li>
            <strong>1.</strong> Gta is my number one pick because theres so much stuff you can do.<br /> your
            Friends can drive around the city chasing eachother you <br /> can do races against eachother.
            You can plan heist that you can <br /> attempt with your friends and you can buy cars. There
            is a huge selection<br /> of cars from a Slow RV to a fast super car. This is why is my
            <br />number one pick for my favorite game.<br /><br />

            <strong>2.</strong> Minecraft is my second pick because theres a whole lot of ideas that you can create.<br />
            You can create almost everything you can think of you<br /> can build houses, schools, castles you name it
            and you can probably build it.<br /> Theres also a survival mode where you can created farms to keep your
            hunger and <br /> theres materials you can gather to build specific materials.

            <p>
              <strong>3.</strong> Rainbow 6 Siege is probably my number third spot because it is a fun <br />game to play
              its about one team is the defenders who protects a hostage<br /> and at the beginning of
              the round they receive a minute to prepare by<br /> reniforcing walls and blocking off
              doors and setting traps the attackers in that<br /> min use RC Drones on wheels with a camera
              to find the hostage location to recieve<br /> a advantage. Then at the end of the minute.
              both teams fight with weapons who <br /> ever wins three rounds or two more rounds than the other
              wins.
