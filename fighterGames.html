        Best Fighter Games <br />

          The best Fighter Games are probably call of duty games this is because its
          one of the most well known fighter games. It is probably because its such an
          enjoyable game most people already know  what call of duty is so il just tell
          about the weapons and the gamemodes. One of the most popular game modes
          right now is warzone its about 100 people dropping in on a map  with a pistol
          and finding chests to get the chance to get better weapons and armour plates
          to put in your vest you have to worry about other players while the gas
          wave gets smaller and smaller where it closes into a small area for a
          free for all. And if you die you get the chance to come back but you
          have to do a 1v1 with a person with the same weapon if you win you come back
          to life if you lose you have to leave or spectate.
          Normal multiplayer like teamdeath match is two teams first team two 100
          elminations win the match theres different weapon attachements that you
          can unlock by using that gun and you can unlock camos while doing challenges with
          that gun.
