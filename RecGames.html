        <h1>Recomended Games</h1><br />
        One of the games i recomend is Warthunder it is a game where you can play as<br />
        as a airplane in Ww2 and its pretty much dogfights with other planes and while<br /> taking down
        equip ments down on the ground like convoys and battleships in the<br /> ocean and bunkers.
        Theres another game mode where in a WW2 theme you can play as a<br /> tank and attack other tanks
        its like capture the objective and there is a system where you <br />need to repair your
        tank when it is damaged
